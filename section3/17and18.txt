# MELTING COMMITS

-> picking one and squashing others = melt all commits in only one.
-> it opens two interactive. 
first: change options
sec: rewrite the commit which is about to create with the squash 
    
    git rebase -i { initial commit } ~ { last commit }

AND 

-> this creates a commit marked with 'fixup' in the beginning

    git commit --fixup { hash of the commit }

-> this pick the next commit and squash automaticly all of that commits that were marked
-> open a interactive page in vim

    git rebase -i --autosquash { hash before of the one you want to pick }
