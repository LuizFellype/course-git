#MANUALLY RESOLVING CONFLICT

-> Most conflicts happen when we are working as a team.
A very common conflict is that of different users changing the same file in it
local. This conflict can be resolved manually within the visual studio code.
-> After trying to push the location to the remote repository where the
files have been changed on the same line, the vscode itself will indicate where
is the conflict, this way:
<<<<<<< HEAD
                      <tag>xxxxxxxxxxx</tag> 
=======
                      <tag>yyyyyyyyyyyy</tag> 
>>>>>>>> hash do commit

-> To solve the very easy, just delete the part that the user wants to remove and leave
the one of your preference.
