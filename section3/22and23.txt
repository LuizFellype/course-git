#AUTOCORRECT

-> Is there a way for vscode to try to figure out some typing error
when to execute some command, and for this we have the command:

    git config --global help.autocorrect 1

#ARCHIVE

-> When the user wants to send their files to another person
in zip, just enter the command:

    git archive master --format=zip --output=master.zip
