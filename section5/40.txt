# FEATURE BRANCH WORKFLOW

* branch for each feature and then make a PR to master
-> avoid conflicts
-> allow to work in parallel, so this is better to work in a big team

-> dont use a branch master ever.  { Josmar Model }:

    git fetch
    git checkout -b { name of the new branch } origin/master
    git commit ...
    (git commit --amend)
    git push origin { name of the branch } (--set-upstream)

-> Go to github, compare and open a PR.
-> After code review - (squash the unuseful commits) and merge with the master.
