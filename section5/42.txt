# GIT-FLOW EXTENSIONS

* set of extensions for git
-> branch model of Vicent Driensen
-> it must be installed

    git flow init
    git flow feature start { name of the new feature }
    git flow feature finish { name of the feature } 

-> the 'finish' command 
- merge with the develop {sort of the master in git};
- delete the feature created going to the develop branch

* there are more stuffs, but I didn't like this git-flow. So I wont write more. ;)
